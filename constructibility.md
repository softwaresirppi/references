# Can
 - Copy Angle
 - Copy Line
 - Bisect Angle
 - Bisect Line
 - Construct Pi
 - Construct Square Root
    x^2 + y^2 = z^2
		Let x = a/2 - half and z = a/2 + half
		(a/2 - half)^2 + y^2 = (a/2 + half)^2
		-a/2 + y^2 = + a/2
		y^2 = 2a/2
		y = sqrt of a
		FACT:
			IF you create a right angle triangle
				with hypotenuse ((half of) a + half)
				and one side ((half of a) - half)
			THEN the other side will be (square root of a)
	- Construct results of + - * / sqrt
IF you create a right angle triangle
	with hypotenuse ((half of) a + half)
	and one side ((half of a) - half)
THEN the other side will be (square root of a)
	- Construct sin x and cos x
		- sin x is the distance of a point in angle 'x' in a unit circle from x axis
		- cos x is the distance of a point in angle 'x' in a unit circle from x axis
		FACT: Law of cosines and sines
			sin(A)/a = sin(B)/b = sin(C)/c
			a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(A)
			b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos(B)
			c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C)
